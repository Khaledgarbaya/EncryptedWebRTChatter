# Encrypted WebRTC Chatter

WebRTC without a signaling server -- the WebRTC offer/answer exchange is performed manually by the users [original link](https://github.com/cjb/serverless-webrtc).

## How it works
 
 1. Create an "**offer**" and copy/paste it to your friend.
 2. They click "join", paste your "**offer**" and send you back an "**answer"**
 3. You paste their "**answer"**
 4. Chat
 
## Todo
* Use localStorage + password to store keys
* Use pseudonames to identify people via keys
* Group chat
